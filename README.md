# Liquid Types in Coq

In this project, we implement and explore Liquid Types using the Coq proof assistant, our work is based on the pathbreaking paper "Liquid Types" by Rondon et al. Our implementation brings to life as to showcase how combining Hindley-Milner type inference with the help of predicate abstraction can enable automatic inference of dependent types powerful enough to prove critical safety properties without extensive use of manual annotation.
